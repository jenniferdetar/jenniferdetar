👋 Hi, I’m @jenniferdetar
👀 I help small businesses grow by managing their back office, accounting, and day-to-day operations.
🌱 I’ve been learning to code—and am proud to share that I’ve been provisionally admitted to the **Professional Certificate in Full Stack Software Development: Building Scalable Cloud Applications** at the **McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin**, starting **August 2025**.
💻 This next chapter is all about leveling up my technical skills to build powerful, scalable tools that help business owners simplify operations.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on cloud-based platforms that combine accounting, task management, and team communication in one ecosystem.
